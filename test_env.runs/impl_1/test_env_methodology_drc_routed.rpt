LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell mpg_2/pcq[31]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) fetch/pcq_reg[25]/CLR, fetch/pcq_reg[26]/CLR, fetch/pcq_reg[27]/CLR,
fetch/pcq_reg[28]/CLR, fetch/pcq_reg[29]/CLR, fetch/pcq_reg[2]/CLR,
fetch/pcq_reg[30]/CLR, fetch/pcq_reg[31]/CLR, fetch/pcq_reg[3]/CLR,
fetch/pcq_reg[4]/CLR, fetch/pcq_reg[5]/CLR, fetch/pcq_reg[6]/CLR,
fetch/pcq_reg[7]/CLR, fetch/pcq_reg[8]/CLR, fetch/pcq_reg[9]/CLR
 (the first 15 of 30 listed). The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
